**Workshop description**

When the public imagines Artificial Intelligence they imagine something like Isaac Asimov’s Positronic Brains: a brain built out of mathematics, logic, and wires but which allow human like interactions. This includes sophisticated language abilities, dialogue, logical thinking, and interaction with the physical world. However, the standard approach of language technology has been to tackle language outside of the realm of embodiment and grounding, tackling it as purely discreet and symbolic and creating isolated models of language without embodiment. However, a vision of robots speaking and interacting with humans in the real world is still alive and poses many scintillating research questions which touch on many different fields of research. There’s the grounding problem, multimodal dialogue, and learning from dialogue and interaction. Such learning must additionally happen incrementally and from few interactions i.e. learning with low resources. This workshop invites researchers interested in related topics to present their work and for dialogue around, for example, the following topics:
* Grounded language understanding and generation
* Multi-modal or embodied interaction
* Incremental or Online Learning
* Low resource learning and adaptation
* Human-AI Interaction
* Multimodal Dialogue
* Interactive Task Learning

This workshop invites researchers in the fields of natural language processing, computer science, language technology, computational linguistics, cognitive computing, AI, computer vision, machine learning, robotics, linguistics, cognitive science, and related fields interested in answering questions related to how we can forge ahead in the quest for robots that can interact with humans. 

Intended participants are researchers, university teachers, masters and PhD students from diverse backgrounds that touch upon the questions related to development and applications of language technology. We foresee an interactive workshop with plenty of time for discussion, complemented with invited talks and presentations of on-going or completed research. To engage participation of students and to foster research in the student community we will organise a special session on student learning with tutorials of practical research methods and applications. Participants are encouraged to submit extended abstracts for both research talks / posters and student tutorials as well as other materials that will be shared with others during the workshop.

The workshop is organised by the Language and Perception part of CLASP at GU  ([website][1]) with the aim of promoting discussion and research collaboration between its members, promote research to students and to wider community interested in the current developments of language technology and AI.
