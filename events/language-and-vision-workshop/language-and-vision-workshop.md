### Workshop Description<a name="description"></a>

We welcome you to the one-day workshop on NLP and multi-modality!

AI, particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP), has received attention from both the general public and the research community. For the general public, interest has recently peaked because NLP has become an important part of many people's lives, with many existing tools and models frequently discussed and debated. This public interest aligns with a recent surge in research focused on building larger neural models that are effective across various computational tasks. However, these end-to-end models are difficult to interpret.

While they primarily learn from text, an important research direction is multi-modality, i.e., models working with texts, images, and other types of data like audio. The attention on NLP and multi-modality is encouraging, but it also introduces numerous challenges and unresolved questions. For instance, what exactly happens inside our NLP models? Can we interpret their processes? Perhaps, splitting a model into multiple, more interpretable parts is the way to go? Other critical questions include: Do these models learn information from text and other modalities to a sufficient degree? How should we represent this information to the models? How do we evaluate these models, and what are the limitations of current benchmarks? How much can we rely on automatic, human, or other types of evaluation? Finally, what can we say about these models in terms of how "human-like" they are?

The workshop aims to bring together researchers who study computational models in both uni-modal (text-only) and multi-modal (text-and-image) domains. It is a forum to discuss many different topics, including language-only and language-and-vision tasks, models, and evaluation methods. We also welcome discussions about relevant insights from studies on human cognition.

The program consists of six talks given by the invited speakers. The day after the workshop, we will have a doctoral thesis defense that everyone is welcome to attend!

* [Kristina Knaving](https://www.ri.se/en/person/kristina-knaving), RISE
   * Generative AI, like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Midjourney, has recently changed our view of what AI can do by entering a traditionally human domain - creativity. What can we truly expect from AI, and what do we want to expect? Kristina will be doing a contemporary and future outlook on AI and generative AI in creative work and society as a whole. There are many opportunities, but also concerns and questions about ethics, democracy, and privacy.
   * *Kristina Knaving* is a senior researcher at RISE, and is responsible for the focus area "The Connected Individual". She has a background in human-computer interaction, visualization, and decision support. Her research focuses on the opportunities, risks, and ethical issues surrounding personal data and AI, and how new technologies affect individuals and society. 
* [Stefan Larsson](https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/stefan-larsson), Lund University
   * **The Perils of Being Normative: Towards a Socio-Legal Framework on Social Norms and Adaptive Technologies**
   * While recent progress has been made in several fields of data-intense AI-research, many applications have been shown to be prone to unintendedly reproduce social biases, sexism and stereotyping. As more of design-based, algorithmic or machine learning methodologies, here called adaptive technologies, become embedded in anything from commonly used software to robotics, there is a need for a developed understanding of what role social norms play in the interplay between human expressions and technology, particularly with regards to fairness. In this presentation, Larsson proposes a theoretical framework for the interplay between adaptive technologies and social norms in order to point to the often normative, non-neutral, aspects of developing and implementing adaptive technologies.
   * *Stefan Larsson* is a senior lecturer and Associate Professor in Technology and Social Change at Lund University, Sweden, Department of Technology and Society at LTH. He is a lawyer and socio-legal researcher that holds a PhD in Sociology of Law as well as a PhD in Spatial Planning. He leads a multidisciplinary research group on AI and Society, that studies the impact of AI-supported technologies in various domains, such as on consumer markets, in the public sector, for health, and social robotics.
* [Juan Carlos Nieves](https://www.umu.se/personal/juan-carlos-nieves/), Umeå University
   * **Framework for Trustworthy AI Education**
   * During this presentation, we will present the Framework for Trustworthy AI Education that was developed during the Erasmus Plus project - Trustworthy AI. The main goal of this Framework is to describe the principles and learning strategies to be followed to develop students’ competencies on Trustworthy AI. Some questions that were approached with the Framework for Trustworthy AI Education are: What strategies are needed for effectively introducing the High-Level Expert Group’s requirements in Higher Education? Which competencies and learning outcomes related to Trustworthy AI should Higher Education students develop? How to assess them? etc.
   * *Juan Carlos Nieves* is an associate professor at the Department of Computing Science, Umeå University (UMU) (Sweden).  He is the programme Director of the MSc programme in Artificial Intelligence at UMU. He is the research leader of the Formal Methods for Trustworthy Hybrid Intelligence group, and an affiliated member of the Responsible Artificial Intelligence group at UMU.  He has been serving as an external (Ethical) advisor/reviewer in different EU projects. He has also served as an expert reviewer for different European national research councils. He has been an AI-ethical advisor for European initiatives such as EU BonAPPS and for American initiatives such as fAIr LAC  of the Inter-American Development Bank.

### Instructions for presenters<a name="instructions"></a>

* Keynote talks will be 45 minutes.
  * 10 minutes of these are intended for questions.
* Lightining talks will be 10 minutes each.
  * After each presentation we will take questions during the change of speakers
  * After the lightning talks there will be 10 minutes for questions for all speakers.
* We hope that additional discussions will take place during the group discussion in the second half of the workshop.

To enable quicker speaker switching, please upload your presentations slides before the talk as pdf to [this shared folder](https://www.dobnik.net/cloud/s/dwn7nmY68aEjatK).
* The folder as well as the slides will be accessible from the presentation computer in the room.
* If you would like to update your slides, simply upload a new version with the same filename.
* Please name your slides as lastname_title.pdf to make it easier for us to know which presentation belongs to who.

If you have have any additional presentation requirements, e.g. slides that are not in pdf, playing video and sound, etc., please [contact Ricardo](mailto:ricardo.munoz.sanchez@gu.se) in advance.
