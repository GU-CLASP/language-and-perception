ROM HT18, Representations of meaning, 7.5 HEC, Representationer av
språklig betydelse, 7,5hp, part of [Doctoral Degree in Computational
Linguistics](https://flov.gu.se/digitalAssets/1605/1605989_asp-fd-datalingvistik-2016ver2.pdf).

The course gives a survey of theory and computational implementations
of representing and reasoning with meaning in natural languages from
cognitive, linguistic and computational perspective. We will look at
formal theories and computational implementations to model-theoretic
semantics (lambda calculus), situated and grounded representations of
meaning, semantic grammars (CCG, dependency grammar), distributional
representations of lexical meaning and its compositional extensions,
approaches to unsupervised machine learning of linguistic
representations, and others. An emphasis of the course will be (i) on
the nature of representations, (ii) how they satisfy the notion of
compositionality, (iii) how they are used in inference or reasoning
and (iv) what natural language processing applications are they useful
for.

Course prerequisites:

  - General admission requirements for a doctoral degree in
    Computational Linguistics or equivalent.

In order to follow the course, the participants should at least have
experience with one or several of the following fields at masters
level:

  - Formal semantics and pragmatics
  - Natural language processing
  - Computational semantics
  - Machine learning
  - or equivalent skills and knowledge.
