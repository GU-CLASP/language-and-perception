## Goal

The goal of this project is to develop and test a chatbot agent working together with one of our two external partners: (i) Stadsbibliotek: Gothenburg City Library, and (ii) the SKANDIBOT project which focuses on the usage of chatbots in second language learning of Danish and Swedish.

## Background

Chatboats are currently used in a variety of applications. In this project we examine  development of a chatbot system in one of the two domains



## Problem description

  - T1: Extracting and modelling interactive strategies for a particular domain from user data and implementing these in one of the chatbot platforms (e.g. RASA, Chatfuel).
  - T2: Adaptation of the chosen chatbot platform for Swedish (and Danish!) data.
  - T3: Expansions of the limuted annotataed data using techniques such as adataset boosting, creation of artificial datasets, and applications of transfer learning from other domains and others.
  - T4: Application and testing of ML models on the datasets from the previous point.
  - T4: Testing of the resulting system in the target domain.
 
## Recommended knowledge and skills

For students in Masters in Language Technology (MLT), the master thesis would build on courses such as (i) Natural Language Processing, (ii) Computational Semantics, (iii) Machine Learning, and (iv) Embodied and situated language processing/Artificial Intelligence: Cognitive systems or equivalent. For other students, experience with (i) Language Technology, (ii) Machine Learning, (iii) Computer Vision, (vi) Robotics, and (vii) Cognitive Science or equivalent is useful. A potential candidate should be comfortable in programming with Python, machine learning and text and image processing tools and techniques.
