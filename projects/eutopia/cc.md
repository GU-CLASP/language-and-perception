### The community

Grounding Human-Centred AI on Embodied Multimodal Interaction, has the objective to investigate the impact and effects of the rapid expansion of AI and language technology in everyday life, education, and scientific research. We want to study the extent of such impacts by building on our experience with linguistic and psycholinguistic research methodologies in the domain of human interaction and multimodality.
