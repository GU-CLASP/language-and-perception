  - The reading group meets on even Fridays 10-12 in the seminar room on the 5th floor of Humanistiska fakulteten, Renströmsgatan 6 and on [on Zoom](https://gu-se.zoom.us/j/726750116).

  - Please add here [here](https://github.com/GU-CLASP/language-and-perception/blob/master/papers.bib) any papers you would like to suggest for the reading group.
    - Write your name and any other comments in the `Note` field. Papers that have been on the list for a while might be moved to [the attic](papers-attic.md).
    - If available, prefer published papers (e.g. ACL) rather than arXiV versions. Papers that are not published online can be uploaded [here](https://linux.dobnik.net/cloud/index.php/s/Z2iPGa28Mexyz24).
    - Add a link to the paper in the `Url` field.

  - Participating gives you [course credit](https://gu-clasp.github.io/language-and-perception/courses/).
  
  - Subscribe to [our mailing list](https://listserv.gu.se/sympa/subscribe/cogsys) to follow discussions.

  - Orgasnisers: Nikolai, Elham, Ricardo and Simon, contact: cosy [at] flov [at] gu [dot] se
