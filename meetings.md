  - The reading group meets on even Fridays 10-12 in the seminar room on the 5th floor of Humanistiska fakulteten, Renströmsgatan 6.

  - Sometimes, and more recently, we meet [online on Zoom](https://gu-se.zoom.us/j/726750116), requires GU-login.

  - Participating gives you [course credit](https://gu-clasp.github.io/language-and-perception/courses/).

  - To add a paper suggestion, simply edit me [here](https://github.com/GU-CLASP/language-and-perception/blob/master/meetings.md). If avaiable, prefer links to the published (e.g. ACL) rather than arXiV versions. Papers that are not published online can be uploaded [here](https://linux.dobnik.net/cloud/index.php/s/Z2iPGa28Mexyz24).
  
  - To vote for papers, add a + before its entry and write your name in the bracket at the end of the entry. For an example see (Hwang et al. 2020) below.
  
  - Subscribe to [our mailing list](https://listserv.gu.se/sympa/subscribe/cogsys) to follow discussions.
